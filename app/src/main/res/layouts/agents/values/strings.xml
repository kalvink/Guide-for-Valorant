In the main game mode, the attacking team has a bomb, called the Spike, that they need to plant on a site. If the attacking team successfully protects the bomb and it detonates, they get a point. If the defending team successfully defuses the bomb, or the 100-second round timer expires, the defending team gets a point. Eliminating all opposing team members also earns a round win. The first team to win the best of 25 rounds wins the match.</string>
