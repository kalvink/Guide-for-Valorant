    <string name="info_obj">Objective:\nTwo teams of five agents play against each other, agents with special unique abilities and use an economy system to purchase utilities and weapons. In the main game mode, the attacking team has a bomb, called the Spike, that they need to plant on a site. If the attacking team successfully protects the bomb and it detonates, they get a point. If the defending team successfully defuses the bomb, or the 100-second round timer expires, the defending team gets a point. Eliminating all opposing team members also earns a round win. The first team to win the best of 25 rounds wins the match.</string>
